Lacona Addon to open Github Repos

In order for the addon to work, you must log into GitHub from the Addon Preferences Page. Once authenticated, you can 
open all of your Repos by name with the command "open brandonhorst/elliptical". It also allows any repos owned by
organizations of which you are a member.

It supports some degree of fuzzy matching (you can type "open elliptical").

Things that it should be able to do eventually, but cannot currently:

- open arbitrary (other people's) repos by name
- bring you straight to the issues/wiki/PRs/commits/whatever page
- open issues/commits/PRs directly by name
- clone repos locally

Things that it could potentially do, but may or may not be a good idea

- create or fork repos
- add comments to issues/commits/PRs
- more?
